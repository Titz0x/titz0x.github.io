# 100 days of information security challenge


Today is my third day of the challenge.
I learned such things:
- Course Smolny Computer Science (FULL):
    - Data structures
    - Sorting
    - Version control systems
    - Basic principles of CPU
    - Multilevel organization of computer systems
    - Fundamentals of computer networking
- HackTheBox (Linux Privilege Escalation)


I plan to finish HTB module and all stepik-courses about CS at this week.
Also, if there is time, I will add tutorials on escalation privileges using various tools.
And starting tomorrow, I'm returning the early risers at 4:30 am
