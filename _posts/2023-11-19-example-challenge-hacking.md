# 100 days of information security challenge

Today is my first day of the challenge.
I started by structuring my plan to understand when and what I should do. Deadlines are important and cool!

As you may have realized by now, I started this week by learning Computer Science. Specifically:
- 6 lectures of CS50 by Harward
- Course "Smolny Computer Science" (15%)

I'm also going to add English to my plan
