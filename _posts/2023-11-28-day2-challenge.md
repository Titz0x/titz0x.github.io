# 100 days of information security challenge


Today is my second day of the challenge.
I learned such things:
- A couple of lectures CS50 ( but I won't watch CS50 anymore because of the bad content )
- Course Smolny Computer Science (62%)
- HackTheBox


I plan to finish the course (stepik) tomorrow, complete the module on HTB and study a significant part of the second course (stepik). Plus, if possible, do not forget about learning English

Learning CS is a bit boring, I'm waiting for practice!
